/**
 * A directive that repeats a series of values (usually `TemplateResults`) generated from an
 * iterable, and updates those items efficiently when the iterable changes based on user-provided
 * `keys` associated with each item.
 *
 * Note that if a `keyFn` is provided, strict key-to-DOM mapping is maintained, meaning previous DOM
 * for a given key is moved into the new position if needed, and DOM will never be reused with
 * values for different keys (new DOM will always be created for new keys). This is generally the
 * most efficient way to use `repeat` since it performs minimum unnecessary work for insertions and
 * removals.
 *
 * The `keyFn` takes two parameters, the item and its index, and returns a unique key value.
 *
 * ```js
 * html`
 *     <ol>
 *         ${repeat(
 *             this.items,
 *             (item) => item.id,
 *             (item, index) => {
 *                 return html`
 *                     <li>${index}: ${item.name}</li>
 *                 `;
 *             },
 *         )}
 *     </ol>
 * `;
 * ```
 *
 * **Important**: If providing a `keyFn`, keys _must_ be unique for all items in a given call to
 * `repeat`. The behavior when two or more items have the same key is undefined.
 *
 * If no `keyFn` is provided, this directive will perform similar to mapping items to values, and
 * DOM will be reused against potentially different items.
